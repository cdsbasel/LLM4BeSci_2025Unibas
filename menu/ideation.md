title: Project Ideation Session
---

The optional project ideation session will take place **Wednesday, February 12th, 2025**. This interactive session is designed to help attendees explore, conceptualize, and develop new and innovative research projects leveraging the potential of (open) Large Language Models (LLMs). Building on the knowledge and inspiration gained during the training and symposium, the ideation session provides a creative and collaborative environment for participants to transform their ideas into actionable projects.

Through brainstorming sessions, and guided activities and mentorship, participants will refine their concepts and receive feedback needed to craft project proposals. Those who participate in this session and submit a project proposal (1-2 pages by Feb 15th) will have the chance to earn an additional credit point, awarded via a Learning Contract.
